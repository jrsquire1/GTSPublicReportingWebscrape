# STS GTS Public Reporting Webscrape
This is a Python script that automates webscraping of publicly reported outcomes for general thoracic surgerical procedures (GTS) in the US.

This project set out to look at publicly reported GTS outcomes as reported by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), a leader in the US cardiovascular surgery space for quality and outcomes reporting. The purpose of scraping this data is to enable a thoracic surgery service line to see the current layout of their competitors, find those that perform better than average, and learn from their practices to improve patient outcomes.

The website being scraped: https://publicreporting.sts.org/gtsd
